# CVE-2021-42013 - Apache 2.4.49 & 2.4.50 Remote Code Execution

## Introduction

Welcome to the documentation addressing CVE-2021-42013, a critical security vulnerability that affects Apache HTTP Server versions 2.4.49 and 2.4.50. This document explores the technical details of the vulnerability and its potential for remote code execution (RCE).

## Background

CVE-2021-42013 is an extension of a previously identified vulnerability, CVE-2021-41773. Although the Apache development team had addressed CVE-2021-41773 in version 2.4.50, it was later discovered that the fix was inadequate in completely mitigating the security risk.

## Vulnerability Description

The vulnerability is rooted in a path traversal attack vector. This allows attackers to manipulate URLs, effectively mapping them to files located outside the intended directories configured by Alias-like directives. When files outside these directories lack appropriate protection, such as the "require all denied" configuration, attackers can exploit this vulnerability.

## Exploitation and Impact

The gravity of this vulnerability escalates if CGI scripts are enabled for the aliased paths. Exploiting this vulnerability grants attackers the ability to execute arbitrary code remotely on the targeted server, potentially leading to a complete system compromise. This emphasizes the urgency of upgrading to secure versions of Apache HTTP Server.

## Proof of Concept (PoC) Exploit

While a detailed PoC exploit is not provided here, a high-level overview is beneficial:

1. Identify a vulnerable Apache HTTP Server version (2.4.49 or 2.4.50).
2. Craft a malicious URL exploiting the path traversal vulnerability.
3. If aliased paths have enabled CGI scripts, inject code via the URL.
4. Execute the exploit to achieve remote code execution.

It's important to note that performing this PoC exploit on unauthorized systems is unethical and illegal. The purpose of understanding the PoC is to comprehend the attack vector and promote robust mitigation measures.

## Mitigation

To effectively counter the risks posed by CVE-2021-42013, it's imperative to upgrade to a version beyond Apache HTTP Server 2.4.50. Regularly monitoring security advisories and promptly applying updates are fundamental practices for upholding web server security.

## Conclusion

CVE-2021-42013 underscores the evolving threat landscape that web administrators and security professionals navigate. A solid understanding of this vulnerability empowers individuals to secure web servers, contributing to a safer online environment.

Please remember that responsible disclosure and ethical considerations are paramount in security research and vulnerability management.
