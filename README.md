## 🚨 CVE-2021-42013 - Apache 2.4.49 & 2.4.50 Remote Code Execution 🚨

CVE-2021-42013 builds upon the previously identified vulnerability, CVE-2021-41773. Despite the Apache team's efforts to address CVE-2021-41773 in version 2.4.50, subsequent investigations revealed that the fix fell short of fully mitigating the security risk.
This vulnerability exploits a path traversal attack vector, allowing attackers to manipulate URLs, mapping them to files outside the intended directories configured by Alias-like directives. When these files lack proper protection, such as the "require all denied" configuration, attackers can exploit this vulnerability by executing commands from the vulnerable path.
### Exploitation and Impact 💥

The severity of this vulnerability escalates if CGI scripts are enabled for the aliased paths. Exploiting CVE-2021-42013 grants attackers the ability to remotely execute arbitrary code on the targeted server, potentially leading to a complete system compromise. It is crucial to act promptly by upgrading to secure versions of Apache HTTP Server.
### Mitigation 🛠️

Effectively countering the risks posed by CVE-2021-42013 requires upgrading to a version beyond Apache HTTP Server 2.4.50. Regularly monitoring security advisories and promptly applying updates are fundamental practices for upholding web server security.
